The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'solana.transaction'` indicates that your code is attempting to import the `Transaction` class from a module path that doesn't exist in the current version of the `solana` Python package. This issue often arises due to changes in module paths between different versions of the package.

**Potential Solutions:**

1. **Adjust Import Statements Based on Version:**
   - **For `solana` Version 0.34.3 and Earlier:**
     - The `Transaction` class is located in `solana.transaction`.
     - Use the import statement: `from solana.transaction import Transaction`.
   - **For `solana` Version 0.35.0 and Later:**
     - The `Transaction` class has been moved, and the package now relies on the `solders` library for core types.
     - Use the import statement: `from solders.transaction import Transaction`.

2. **Ensure Consistent Package Versions:**
   - Verify that all dependencies are compatible with each other.
   - If you're using `solana` version 0.35.0 or later, ensure that the `solders` package is installed and up to date.
   - If your project relies on the module structure of `solana` version 0.34.3 or earlier, consider downgrading to a compatible version by running:
     ```
     pip install solana==0.34.3
     ```

**Recommended Steps:**

1. **Check Your Current `solana` Package Version:**
   - In your Python environment, execute:
     ```python
     import solana
     print(solana.__version__)
     ```
   - This will display the installed version of the `solana` package.

2. **Modify Import Statements Accordingly:**
   - Based on the version identified:
     - If you're using version 0.34.3 or earlier, ensure your import statements align with that version's module structure.
     - If you're using version 0.35.0 or later, update your import statements to reflect the new module paths, incorporating the `solders` package as needed.

By aligning your import statements with the correct module paths corresponding to your installed `solana` package version, you can resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` and ensure your code functions as intended.
