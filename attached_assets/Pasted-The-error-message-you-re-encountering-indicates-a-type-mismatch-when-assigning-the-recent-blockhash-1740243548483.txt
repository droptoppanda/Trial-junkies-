The error message you're encountering indicates a type mismatch when assigning the `recent_blockhash` to a `Transaction` object in the `solana-py` library. This issue arises because the `Transaction` class expects a `Hash` object for the `recent_blockhash` attribute, but it's receiving a `bytes` object instead.

**Understanding the Issue:**

In recent versions of `solana-py`, particularly from v0.36.0 onwards, there's been a transition to using the `solders` library for certain data structures, including `Transaction` and `Hash`. This change means that when constructing transactions, the `recent_blockhash` must be of the `solders.hash.Hash` type. If a `bytes` object is provided instead, it leads to the conversion error you're seeing.

**Recommended Solution:**

To resolve this issue, ensure that you're using the `Transaction` class from the `solders.transaction` module and that the `recent_blockhash` is appropriately converted to a `solders.hash.Hash` object. Here's how you can modify your code:

1. **Import the Necessary Modules:**

   ```python
   from solders.transaction import Transaction
   from solders.hash import Hash
   ```


2. **Fetch the Latest Blockhash:**

   ```python
   blockhash_resp = await client.get_latest_blockhash()
   recent_blockhash = blockhash_resp.value.blockhash
   ```


3. **Convert the Blockhash to `Hash` Type:**

   ```python
   recent_blockhash = Hash.from_string(recent_blockhash)
   ```


4. **Create the Transaction:**

   ```python
   transaction = Transaction(recent_blockhash=recent_blockhash)
   # Add your instructions to the transaction here
   ```


By ensuring that both the `Transaction` and `Hash` classes are imported from `solders`, and converting the `recent_blockhash` to the correct type, you can prevent the type conversion error.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Library Version:** Ensure that you're using a compatible version of `solana-py` that integrates with `solders`. Versions from v0.36.0 onwards have this integration.

- **Dependencies:** If you're using other libraries or modules that depend on `solana-py`, verify that they're compatible with the version you're using, especially after the transition to `solders`.
