Troubleshooting Steps
Ensure Proper Blockhash Conversion: When you retrieve the blockhash from the Solana client, it is a string, but you need to convert it to a Hash type. Here’s how you can do it:

Update your payment processing code as follows:

python
Copy
Edit
from solana.rpc.api import Client
from solana.rpc.types import Hash, TxOpts
from solana.transaction import Transaction
from solana.system_program import transfer

# Initialize the Solana client
solana_client = Client("https://api.devnet.solana.com")

# Payment processing function
def process_payment(from_keypair, to_public_key, amount):
    # Get the latest blockhash
    response = solana_client.get_recent_blockhash()
    blockhash = response['result']['value']['blockhash']
    
    # Convert blockhash string to Hash type
    blockhash_hash = Hash(blockhash)

    # Create the transfer instruction
    transfer_instruction = transfer(
        TransferParams(
            from_pubkey=from_keypair.public_key,
            to_pubkey=to_public_key,
            lamports=amount,
        )
    )

    # Create a transaction
    transaction = Transaction()
    transaction.add(transfer_instruction)
    transaction.recent_blockhash = blockhash_hash  # Ensure this is of type Hash

    # Sign and send the transaction
    response = solana_client.send_transaction(transaction, from_keypair)
    return response['result']['meta']['err'] is None  # Return True if no error
Update the Test Case: Make sure your test case is properly set up to simulate the behavior of the Solana client. Here’s an example of how to structure the test:

python
Copy
Edit
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from your_module import process_payment  # Update this import according to your module

class TestSolanaPay(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('solana.rpc.api.Client.get_recent_blockhash')
    @patch('solana.rpc.api.Client.send_transaction')
    def test_process_payment(self, mock_send_transaction, mock_get_recent_blockhash):
        # Mocking the response for get_recent_blockhash
        mock_get_recent_blockhash.return_value = {
            'result': {
                'value': {
                    'blockhash': 'your_blockhash_string'  # Use a valid blockhash string for testing
                }
            }
        }

        # Mocking send_transaction response
        mock_send_transaction.return_value = {
            'result': {
                'meta': {
                    'err': None  # Simulate a successful transaction
                }
            }
        }

        # Call the payment processing function
        success = process_payment(from_keypair, to_public_key, amount)

        # Assert that the payment was processed successfully
        self.assertTrue(success)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Handle Resource Warnings: The warnings about unclosed sockets can be addressed by ensuring that all connections are properly closed. If you are using a context manager or explicit connection closing in your code, double-check to make sure it’s being handled correctly.

Conclusion
After making these adjustments, rerun your tests. If the payment processing issue persists, please provide the updated code for your process_payment function and the test case, and I can assist you further in debugging.
